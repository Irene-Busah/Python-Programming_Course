# ------------- TASK 2 -----------------
# Create class and sub-class objects which represent different
# geometrical shapes, such as Rectangles and Squares

# ------------- TASK 3 -----------------
# Create a lottery ball, or Hat, that takes a variable number of arguments that
# specify the number of balls of each color that are in the hat. Give the object
# the ability to pick a random number of balls from the hat, which will then be
# used to compute the probability of picking a certain distribution of balls over
# a large number of experiments
